# Welcome to Open3DIY.org

Open3DIY.org is a GitHub-hosted site dedicated to software solutions, electronics, and technological innovation. It is a space for enthusiasts to learn, share, and collaborate with one another through do-it-yourself (DIY)-style guides.

## What is Open3DIY?

Open3DIY is more than just a repository of projects—it is a hub for:

- **Innovation**: Sharing cutting-edge projects and solutions in technology.
- **Learning**: Providing clear, step-by-step instructions for enthusiasts of all skill levels.
- **Collaboration**: Encouraging teamwork and knowledge exchange within a vibrant community.
- **Purpose-driven DIY**: Empowering creators to work on projects that align with their personal goals and aspirations.

## Our Purpose

At Open3DIY, every contributor has a unique purpose. The site is designed to:

1. **Declare Purpose**: Contributors define the goals behind their projects.
2. **Create Clear Instructions**: Provide detailed, easy-to-follow steps so others can replicate or build upon the work.
3. **Foster Collaboration**: Enable users to collaborate on projects and share insights to improve outcomes.

This focus on purpose-driven projects makes Open3DIY a unique DIY platform, emphasizing both the process and the intentions behind the work.

## Our Philosophy

Now that we're getting to know each other, let's agree on a few terms:

- Everything we do here consists of open solutions. Not only is the content open, as you can see in the [license file](LICENSE), but any solution shared here must be replicable using open tools and technologies—or at least the most open possible.

- We try to use—and why not say it, copy—what works well for most people. We’d rather not reinvent the wheel. I don’t think there’s a golden rule; exceptions exist. But if you feel the need to satisfy your ego, go ahead—just let the rest of us know.

- We believe in the need for resilient systems that stand the test of time. We rely on each other, and that won’t change, but whenever possible, and if we have a choice, we try to avoid easy solutions that are too centralized or proprietary.

- Nothing will be perfect from the start. We adopt a continuous improvement approach, iterative or kaizen—call it what you will. The point is, if we get stuck trying to make everything perfect from the beginning, we simply won't do anything. Wouldn't you agree?

- This site combines theoretical or educational explanations with a practical focus. Everything shared here serves a purpose and is functional. If it doesn't work or have a real application, it simply doesn't belong here. Sharing solutions that don't deliver real value is frustrating for everyone.

## How It Works

### 1. Explore

Browse the wide range of DIY guides, projects, and solutions available in the repository. Use them to:

- Learn new skills.
- Get inspired by others' innovations.
- Adapt ideas to suit your own projects.

### 2. Contribute

There are many ways to contribute: opening issues in specific repositories, joining [community discussions](https://github.com/orgs/open3diy/discussions), forking existing projects, or even proposing new repositories.

When creating a new one, follow the thematic scope: first define the area (e.g., web3 or robotics), then your personal angle (web3-101 as an introduction, web3-letsfun for a more playful approach). Multiple perspectives on the same area are welcome.
